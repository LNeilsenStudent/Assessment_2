            Ashwani, Christopher and Alex, have similar ideal jobs, the only contrast is that they currently aspire to reach different levels of management. According to research <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(ICT Security Specialists, Labour Market Insights, 2022)</a>, the positions that they want to obtain require them to be proficient in such tasks as accepting responsibility for the processes, procedures and operational management associated with system security and disaster recovery planning, the ability to liaise with security vendors, suppliers, service providers, external resources and analyse, recommend, install and maintain software security applications, monitor contractual obligations, performance delivery and service level agreements. To perform successfully, the required general skills would be communication, problem-solving, planning, leadership, and teamwork/collaboration. IT-specific skills that they will require would be SQL, technical support, project management and business analysis.

            Lachlan’s ideal job is a .NET Developer. The required general skills he will need to obtain would be communication, problem-solving, troubleshooting, planning and quality assurance and control due to research (Developer Programmers, Labour Market Insights, 2022); the following tasks are performed which are; write and maintain program code to meet system requirements, system designs, technical specifications per quality accredited standards and write, update, maintain a technical programme, end-user documentation and operational procedures. Lachlan will require fluency in C++ and similar coding languages such as python, ruby, java, and C# to ensure his flexibility when partaking in projects.

            Ida’s dream job position is Quality Assurance Test Engineer within the biomedical industry. According to (ACS Australia, 2022, p. 57), the ICT and biomedical industries see the highest and third highest amount of R&D funding per year, with $7.1 million for ICT and $2.2 million for biomedicine in the year 2019-2020. Despite the high funding granted to research, <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/96273/assignments/754275">(National Skills Commission, 2021)</a> reports a national shortage of Quality Assurance Managers and predicts a strong future demand. These figures are firmly supported by (Burning Glass Technologies, 2022), which suggests Quality Assurance Managers are the 4th most highly demanded position by employers. Ida’s dream job position is in very high demand and has access to ample funding. Due to the field being so R&D dependent, it is worth noting that these conditions may change over time as particular research drifts in and out of focus. The IT skills that the team processes rank high according to (Burning Glass Technologies, Top Titles, 2018). General/basic skills that the team has acquired from previous personal and professional experiences also rank very high, especially communication skills which is the most in-demand according to Skills in Greatest Demand, Baseline Skills, 2018. The three highest specific skills that are in demand but are not possessed by the team are the following: Microsoft Windows, SAP, and graphic design. The three highest ranked general skills not present are writing, research and mentoring.
