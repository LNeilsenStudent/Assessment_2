          <h6>GitHub</h6>
          <p>
            Our main method of collaboration between team members. We have a repository for this assignment which all files are Committed to, with an audit trail of activity, and a way to revert changes easily. As the assignment progressed, group members learned, and became more comfortable with GitHub. There has been a noticeable increase in Commit frequency as the assignment has progressed, and because of this the audit trail on our repository isn’t an ideal indication of our group’s work. Team members are in a good position to move into the next group assignment with a more comprehensive audit trail of Git Commits.

        <h4>Personal Information</h4>
          <p>Student Number: s3987656</p>
            <p>
              My name is Alex, I am 30, I have relocated to Brasilia, Brazil, and I love it. I am a loving husband and Father of
              twin boys with another set of twins on the way. I am Australian, born and raised in Sydney. I have studied after school;
              my significant achievement is attaining the Diploma of Security and Risk Management, which created my interest in information
              technology. I am a native English speaker and can speak Portuguese at an intermediate level; this has helped me professionally
              and has created many opportunities. I am interested in physical activities and team sports. I like to read about politics
              and economics, but I mostly enjoy sports, Cricket and Rugby being my favourites.
            </p>
        <h4>Team Profile</h4>
          <p>
            The test results opened my eyes to my attributes, and I was unaware of some traits the test claimed I had. I felt very
            accomplished with the result such as “humanitarian”, “innovator”, and “caretaker”, which I believe are very authentic.
            However, I was also taken aback by such claims of being “judging”; until now, I believed I did not display this trait.
            It would influence my behaviour positively due to claims that I am a “humanitarian” and a “caretaker”. I am a team player
            and willing to perform any task assigned. I believe I would excel at speaking and writing tasks due to having prior
            experience with this before, where Git and GitHub skills I found difficulty with, but I am doing extra study to compensate.
