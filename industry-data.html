            Alex’s dream job is to work as a Cyber Security Specialist. Along with 32% of professionals who enter the IT industry <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>. Alex has been drawn to this field by the high flexibility in working hours and locations. <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">National Skills Commission, 2021, p. 12</a>, 2021, p. 12) projects a strong future demand for both Cyber Security and ICT Security Specialists as well as a national shortage of Security Consultants <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">(National Skills Commission, 2021, p. 12)</a>. The recent spike in demand for Cyber Security Specialists is because “cybercrime losses in Australia reached $33 billion over the 2020-2021… well-developed cyber capabilities will be key to limiting these attacks”. As a result, many recent changes have been made in the Cyber Security sector, including “$60 million in grant funding was made available through the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund” <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>, and “a dedicated minister to the area in the Australian Parliament” <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>. The field of Cyber Security is in particularly high demand, and will likely stay that way for the foreseeable future.          </p>

          <div><h6>Lachie - .NET Developer</h6></div>
          <img data-modal-target="#modal" class="stock-icon float-right" src="images/NET-icon.jpg" alt="Image of learning" id="dotnet-icon">

          <p>
            <br> 
            Lachie’s dream job is to be a .NET Developer in an industry sector which relates to electrical text equipment. Although the figures regarding this 
            specific industry are unclear due to the international nature of the work, the demand for .NET development in Australia is quite low. In the year 2020, 
            less than 5% of IT roles asked for any kind of .NET development skills <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(Burning Glass Technologies, 2022, specialized skills)</a> .  Despite a low number of positions calling for these skills, 
            <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">(National Skills Commission, 2021)</a> predicts a strong future demand for programmers and developers. This would suggest that despite low numbers of positions calling 
            for these specific skills, there are not enough programmers in the work force to fill these roles. This position may be difficult to attain given its scarcity, 
            but is likely to be in reasonable demand for a long time.        
            <br><br>
            These figures have highlighted to me that .NET development is low in demand, which will likely make suitable employment difficult to find. This may be offset by the fact that there appears to be a shortage of .NET developers in Australia. While this will rectify the odds of landing a position when applying, it is important to consider that not all workplaces/positions which require .NET developer skills will be suitable for me. This means that the already small pool of potential jobs is even smaller by the time I eliminate roles or companies that would not be suitable for me and my lifestyle. A small selection of potential job prospects does not mean the career path is unfeasible, it just means that I may benefit from broadening my horizons. This data has not changed my ideal job, but has lead me to realize how greatly I will benefit from maintaining my leadership and interpersonal skills, as well as my programming skills in a wide array of languages. This would greatly widen my list of potential job opportunities.
