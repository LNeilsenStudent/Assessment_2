            Alex’s dream job is to work as a Cyber Security Specialist. Along with 32% of professionals who enter the IT industry
            <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>. Alex has been drawn
            to this field by the high flexibility in working hours and locations.
            <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">National Skills Commission, 2021, p. 12</a> projects a strong
            future demand for both Cyber Security and ICT Security Specialists as well as a national shortage of Security Consultants
            <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">(National Skills Commission, 2021, p. 12)</a>.
            The recent spike in demand for Cyber Security Specialists is because “cybercrime losses in Australia reached $33 billion over the 2020-2021… well-developed cyber
            capabilities will be key to limiting these attacks”. As a result, many recent changes have been made in the Cyber Security sector, including “$60 million in grant funding
            was made available through the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund”
            <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>, and “a dedicated minister to
            the area in the Australian Parliament” <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 41)</a>.
            The field of Cyber Security is in particularly high demand, and will likely stay that way for the foreseeable future.          </p>

            Lachie’s dream job is to be a .NET Developer in an industry sector which relates to electrical text equipment. Although the figures regarding this
            specific industry are unclear due to the international nature of the work, the demand for .NET development in Australia is quite low. In the year 2020,
            less than 5% of IT roles asked for any kind of .NET development skills <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(Burning Glass Technologies, 2022, specialized skills)</a>.  Despite a low number of positions calling for these skills,
            <a href="https://www.nationalskillscommission.gov.au/publications/2021-skills-priority-list">(National Skills Commission, 2021)</a> predicts a strong future demand for programmers and developers. This would suggest that despite low numbers of positions calling
            for these specific skills, there are not enough programmers in the work force to fill these roles. This position may be difficult to attain given its scarcity,
            but is likely to be in reasonable demand for a long time.
            <br><br>
            These figures have highlighted to me that .NET development is low in demand, which will likely make suitable employment difficult to find. This may be offset by the fact that there appears to be a shortage of .NET developers in Australia. While this will rectify the odds of landing a position when applying, it is important to consider that not all workplaces/positions which require .NET developer skills will be suitable for me. This means that the already small pool of potential jobs is even smaller by the time I eliminate roles or companies that would not be suitable for me and my lifestyle. A small selection of potential job prospects does not mean the career path is unfeasible, it just means that I may benefit from broadening my horizons. This data has not changed my ideal job, but has lead me to realize how greatly I will benefit from maintaining my leadership and interpersonal skills, as well as my programming skills in a wide array of languages. This would greatly widen my list of potential job opportunities.

            Ida’s dream job position is Quality Assurance Test Engineer, within the biomedical industry. According to
            <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/digital-pulse2022.html">(ACS Australia, 2022, p. 57)</a>, the ICT and biomedical
            industries respectively see the highest, and third highest amount of R&D funding per year; with $7.1 million to ICT, and $2.2 million to biomedicine in the year
            2019-2020. Despite the high funding granted to research, (National Skills Commission, 2021) reports a national shortage of Quality Assurance Managers and predicts
            a strong future demand. These figures are firmly supported by <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(Burning Glass Technologies, 2022, Top Titles)</a>, which suggests Quality Assurance Managers are the 4th most highly
            demanded position by employers. Ida’s dream job position is in very high demand, has access to ample funding. Due to the field being so R&D dependent, it is worth
            noting that these conditions may change over time, as particular research drifts in and out of focus.

            Chris dreams to be an IT team Leader for – specifically for the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex. According to <a href="https://www.cmtedd.act.gov.au/economic-development/business-and-innovation/defence/companies/space/canberra-deep-space-communication-complex">ACT Government</a>, the station is internationally funded,
            as it “is part of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)”. Due to the unique nature of the position alongside its international importance, this job position highly competed for, but will
            likely see long-term funding – this means lower demand for labour with higher job stability. Chris’s “Team Scores” test showed his most suited team roles are as an Expert, a Team Player,
            and a Completer. According to <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(Burning Glass Technologies, 2022, General Skills)</a> these positions align strongly with the top three skills in greatest demand (communication, problem solving and organization).
            Chris will need to maintain high-demand skills throughout his career, as the Team Leader positions are in particularly low demand, in contrast to other IT roles. According to <a href="https://labourmarketinsights.gov.au/">(Burning Glass Technologies, 2022, Top Titles)</a>
            only 3,383 positions out of 12,153 IT job positions were senior positions. This means that within the IT industry in Australia, senior positions represent less than one third of all available jobs.
            Chris has many skills which are in high demand, and is aiming for a position which is in relatively low demand.

            After reviewing the Burning Glass data, my opinion of my ideal job being ICT Team Leader has been influenced. I have not changed my ideal job to any other position, quite the opposite.
            The data showed that the skills required for the role aligned well
            with my personality test results from our first assignment. Though the demand for senior positions within IT is lower in comparison to non-senior positions, this is appealing to me as I would like to gain experience
            and work my way up to ICT Team Leader. I’m in no hurry to reach my ideal job, and am more than willing to learn and develop beforehand so I can be effective in the role.

            Ash’s dream job is to be a manager in the field of Cyber Security. According to (Australian Government, n.d., p. 4) is one of the eight fields in which “Rapid change means
            Australia faces current shortages”. As a result, ethe Australian Government has spent “$230 million… for the period up to 2020” (Australian Government, n.d., p. 43). This is
            a huge influx of funding to the Cyber-Security industry, and means greater job opportunities for prospective and existing workers. Hough management roles make up a lower
            portion of jobs than frontline roles, (Burning Glass Technologies, 2022) lists Project Management as the fifth-most desired specialized skill in the IT industry. Management roles
            appear to be in moderate demand, while Cyber Security roles are currently in very high demand, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the Cyber Security. Ash’s dream job seems to be
            in high demand, but he will need to maintain his skills, in order to keep up with the industry.
