My name is Alex, I am 30, I have relocated to Brasilia, Brazil, and I love it. I am a loving husband and Father of twin boys with another set of twins on the way. 
I am Australian, born and raised in Sydney. I have studied after school; my significant achievement is attaining the Diploma of Security and Risk Management, which created 
my interest in information technology. I am a native English speaker and can speak Portuguese at an intermediate level; this has helped me professionally and has created many opportunities. I am 
interested in physical activities and team sports. I like to read about politics and economics, but I mostly enjoy sports, Cricket and Rugby being my favourites.
The test results opened my eyes to my attributes, and I was unaware of some traits the test claimed I had. I felt very accomplished with the result such as “humanitarian”, “innovator”, and “caretaker”, 
which I believe are very authentic. However, I was also taken aback by such claims of being “judging”; until now, I believed I did not display this trait. It would influence my behaviour positively due to claims that I am a “humanitarian” and a “caretaker”.
I am a team player and willing to perform any task assigned. I believe I would excel at speaking and writing tasks due to having prior expierience with this before, where Git and GitHUb skills I found difficulty with, but I am doing extra study to compensate.
