My name is Lachlan Neilsen, I am a High Voltage Tester, and I have recently commenced Bachelor of IT with RMIT. I am a slightly introverted, open-minded worker with a primarily hands-on learning style. My greatest strength (as highlighted by Myer-Briggs) is my persistent need for clear, decisive answers. As an INTJ-A personality type, I pay great attention to detail, and as a result I usually complete tasks at a very high standard. My Greatest weakness (as highlighted by Big 5 results) is a relatively low extraversion, coupled with 69% neuroticism. If care is not taken this could lead to insular work patterns, and disproportionate doubt in my work.
