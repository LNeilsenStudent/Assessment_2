            A cloud server is a virtual or physical server, hosted by a cloud service provider, that customers create or access via an internet connection. A cloud server is physical
            or virtual software that provides data storage. Some servers are created using virtualization software called hypervisor into multiple virtual servers. A hypervisor abstracts
            the server’s processing power and pools them together, creating virtual servers. Cloud service providers use an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) model to make virtual or bare
            metal server available to customers. Cloud servers work just like physical servers, and they perform similar functions like storing data and running applications. Because cloud
            services are hosted by third party providers, they deliver computing resources over a network, most often through internet. Cloud servers can be located anywhere in the world and
            deliver services remotely through a cloud computing environment. In contrast traditional dedicated server hardware is typically set up on premises for exclusive use by one organization.

              <li>
                <p>
                	•	Determine if we have variable workload or data sensitive workload. Cloud servers are best suited for variable workloads.

              Today It has become an enabler of business and individuals alike. Business organizations are moving towards automation business intelligence and much more, while individuals are reaping the rewards of universally accessible data backup. Cloud computing is one of the most prominent tools being used by modern business organizations, because it provides a way for business to manage their resources online. It allows the business entities to access their information virtually whereby data can be accessed anytime anywhere.            </p>
            <p>
              Despite its prominence, cloud computing is unlikely to replace very many jobs. While it makes workflow more efficient, it does not replace any of the people who were utilising it’s classic predecessor (standard server technology). The only jobs which may be impacted are those of Communication Technicians. At the same time, cloud computing creates many equivalent jobs, through construction and maintenance of data centres and other associated physical infrastructure. In regards to digital infrastructure, more jobs are created for programming and maintaining the virtual aspects of the cloud. Overall, cloud computing is likely to have near-exclusively positive impacts on both everyday people, and business.            </p>
            <p>
              Computer equipment generates a lot of heat and so data centres must be kept cool. Cooling typically accounts for 40% of total energy consumption and up to 80% if the natural climate of the data centre is warmer. Furthermore, an additional environmental impact of cloud computing is the electronic waste produced by industry. In 2018, 50 million metric tons of e waste was generated globally, as for commercial reasons, equipment is often replaced as soon as more efficient technology becomes available. Other environmental impacts of data storage include coolant chemicals used in the server rooms, which are often hazardous and battery back ups of data centres. The components of these batteries are often mined unsustainably, and disposal of both toxic batteries and the chemical coolant could have a devastating impact on the local environment if not properly managed.

            <h6>What are the impacts of Cloud computing?</h6>
            <p>
              Cloud servers’ function similar to traditional servers since they both deliver processing power, applications and storage. However, since cloud servers are remotely accessed, they are generally more stable and secure than the traditional servers. The primary difference between a cloud server and traditional server is that a cloud server can be shared among many users over an accessible platform, often through a network such as the internet. A traditional (dedicated) server is only accessed by a given company or entity. While cloud servers perform the same functions as physical servers, cloud servers are hosted and delivered over a network rather than set up and managed over a network rather than set up and managed on site. Another difference between the cloud server versus physical server is that cloud server offers unlimited compute capacity, but physical servers are limited to their existing infrastructure or computing capacity. When comparing a cloud server verses physical server, we have to consider that physical servers are typically more customizable than cloud servers and offer more computing power, extra random-access memory and access to back up power. Due to it’s massively greater capabilities, it is likely that cloud computing will eventually replace nearly all traditional servers. There are three types of cloud servers, public, private and hybrid. In public cloud, third party cloud service providers deliver computing resources, like severs, over the internet. All hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. In contrast to public cloud servers, private cloud servers are used exclusively by a single business or organization and are often most secure. Servers can be physically located at an onsite datacentre or a third-party service provider can host a private cloud that’s made accessible through a private network. Hybrid cloud servers are the state of the art technology in cloud computing, as combine both public and private clouds. This allows data to move between public and private clouds, giving business greater flexibility more deployment options and opportunities to optimize existing infrastructure, security and compliance. As a result of it’s integration with new technologies, such as hybrid servers, cloud computing will be an important technology for a long time to come.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud computing is more efficient and resilient than local computing capacity for individuals and firms and also offer geographic redundancy, making data loss unlikely even in the event of a natural disaster. A 2013 research paper funded by google, revealed that while moving commonly used software applications to the cloud energy usage would decrease by 87%. Further cloud computing is a major enabler of both home and remote working, reducing the need for commuting and therefore decreasing emissions.

              <li>
                <p>
                  •	Cost Reduction: Cloud computing works on the concept of pay per use, cloud computing helps in reducing the expenses of the company as resources are acquired only when they are needed, and payment is made as per usage. Cloud computing can cause a dramatic decrease in labour and maintenance costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Scalability: This is the key benefits of cloud computing as the client has flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources as per the requirements of the organization. Business need not worry about future demands as they can easily scale up the resources and acquire additional services anytime.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Flexibility: Cloud computing provides a lot of flexibility. Customers and users are free to decide about the services which they want to use and pay also users have the option to switch from one cloud to another. Users can choose public, private or hybrid storage based on their security needs and other factors.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Almost Unlimited Storage: Users can store a lot more data on the cloud than their local physical storage devices. Moreover, companies can scale their storage capacity as per their requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Disaster Recovery: A business using cloud computing need not prepare complex disaster recovery plans because the service provider takes care of such issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Users can opt for a shared hosting plan those scales depending on needs.
                </p>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Cloud computing is opposed by many, due to it’s supposed climate impact – even though it has been proven to be vastly more efficient than it’s rival technologies. Due to it’s efficiency, alongside the huge list of practical benefits, cloud comping will unlikely be superseded any time in the foreseeable future. In comparison to any other technology available, the potential of cloud computing is infinitely greater, meaning that until an even more impressive technology is developed, no technology will surpass it in data storage capabilities or efficiency.
