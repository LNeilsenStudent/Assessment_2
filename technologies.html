          <p>
            A cloud server is a virtual or physical server, hosted by a cloud service provider, that customers create or access via an internet connection. A cloud server is physical
            or virtual software that provides data storage. Some servers are created using virtualization software called hypervisor into multiple virtual servers. A hypervisor abstracts
            the server’s processing power and pools them together, creating virtual servers. Cloud service providers use an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) model to make virtual or bare
            metal server available to customers. Cloud servers work just like physical servers, and they perform similar functions like storing data and running applications. Because cloud
            services are hosted by third party providers, they deliver computing resources over a network, most often through internet. Cloud servers can be located anywhere in the world and
            deliver services remotely through a cloud computing environment. In contrast traditional dedicated server hardware is typically set up on premises for exclusive use by one organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the key features include:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  •	Computing infrastructure that can be physical (bare metal), virtual or a mix of the two depending on use case.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Has all the capabilities of an on-premises server.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Enable users to process intensive workloads and storage large volumes of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Automated services are accessed on demand through an API.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Gives users the choice of monthly or as you go payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Users can opt for a shared hosting plan those scales depending on needs.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>
              The following steps should be considered while choosing a cloud server:
            </h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                	•	Determine if we have variable workload or data sensitive workload. Cloud servers are best suited for variable workloads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Should categorize our need based on budget, provider and technology requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	We should be able to define our security needs and decide if we can sustain outages. 
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>How will this affect us?</h6>
            <p>
              Today It has become an enabler of business and individuals alike. Business organizations are moving towards automation business intelligence and much more, while individuals are reaping the rewards of universally accessible data backup. Cloud computing is one of the most prominent tools being used by modern business organizations, because it provides a way for business to manage their resources online. It allows the business entities to access their information virtually whereby data can be accessed anytime anywhere.            </p>
            <p>
              Despite its prominence, cloud computing is unlikely to replace very many jobs. While it makes workflow more efficient, it does not replace any of the people who were utilising it’s classic predecessor (standard server technology). The only jobs which may be impacted are those of Communication Technicians. At the same time, cloud computing creates many equivalent jobs, through construction and maintenance of data centres and other associated physical infrastructure. In regards to digital infrastructure, more jobs are created for programming and maintaining the virtual aspects of the cloud. Overall, cloud computing is likely to have near-exclusively positive impacts on both everyday people, and business.            </p>
            <p>
              Computer equipment generates a lot of heat and so data centres must be kept cool. Cooling typically accounts for 40% of total energy consumption and up to 80% if the natural climate of the data centre is warmer. Furthermore, an additional environmental impact of cloud computing is the electronic waste produced by industry. In 2018, 50 million metric tons of e waste was generated globally, as for commercial reasons, equipment is often replaced as soon as more efficient technology becomes available. Other environmental impacts of data storage include coolant chemicals used in the server rooms, which are often hazardous and battery back ups of data centres. The components of these batteries are often mined unsustainably, and disposal of both toxic batteries and the chemical coolant could have a devastating impact on the local environment if not properly managed.            
            </p>

            <h6>What are the impacts of Cloud computing?</h6>
            <p>
              Cloud servers’ function similar to traditional servers since they both deliver processing power, applications and storage. However, since cloud servers are remotely accessed, they are generally more stable and secure than the traditional servers. The primary difference between a cloud server and traditional server is that a cloud server can be shared among many users over an accessible platform, often through a network such as the internet. A traditional (dedicated) server is only accessed by a given company or entity. While cloud servers perform the same functions as physical servers, cloud servers are hosted and delivered over a network rather than set up and managed over a network rather than set up and managed on site. Another difference between the cloud server versus physical server is that cloud server offers unlimited compute capacity, but physical servers are limited to their existing infrastructure or computing capacity. When comparing a cloud server verses physical server, we have to consider that physical servers are typically more customizable than cloud servers and offer more computing power, extra random-access memory and access to back up power. Due to it’s massively greater capabilities, it is likely that cloud computing will eventually replace nearly all traditional servers. There are three types of cloud servers, public, private and hybrid. In public cloud, third party cloud service providers deliver computing resources, like severs, over the internet. All hardware, software and supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. In contrast to public cloud servers, private cloud servers are used exclusively by a single business or organization and are often most secure. Servers can be physically located at an onsite datacentre or a third-party service provider can host a private cloud that’s made accessible through a private network. Hybrid cloud servers are the state of the art technology in cloud computing, as combine both public and private clouds. This allows data to move between public and private clouds, giving business greater flexibility more deployment options and opportunities to optimize existing infrastructure, security and compliance. As a result of it’s integration with new technologies, such as hybrid servers, cloud computing will be an important technology for a long time to come.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Cloud computing is more efficient and resilient than local computing capacity for individuals and firms and also offer geographic redundancy, making data loss unlikely even in the event of a natural disaster. A 2013 research paper funded by google, revealed that while moving commonly used software applications to the cloud energy usage would decrease by 87%. Further cloud computing is a major enabler of both home and remote working, reducing the need for commuting and therefore decreasing emissions.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  •	Cost Reduction: Cloud computing works on the concept of pay per use, cloud computing helps in reducing the expenses of the company as resources are acquired only when they are needed, and payment is made as per usage. Cloud computing can cause a dramatic decrease in labour and maintenance costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Scalability: This is the key benefits of cloud computing as the client has flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources as per the requirements of the organization. Business need not worry about future demands as they can easily scale up the resources and acquire additional services anytime.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  • Flexibility: Cloud computing provides a lot of flexibility. Customers and users are free to decide about the services which they want to use and pay also users have the option to switch from one cloud to another. Users can choose public, private or hybrid storage based on their security needs and other factors.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Almost Unlimited Storage: Users can store a lot more data on the cloud than their local physical storage devices. Moreover, companies can scale their storage capacity as per their requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Disaster Recovery: A business using cloud computing need not prepare complex disaster recovery plans because the service provider takes care of such issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Users can opt for a shared hosting plan those scales depending on needs.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Cloud computing is opposed by many, due to it’s supposed climate impact – even though it has been proven to be vastly more efficient than it’s rival technologies. Due to it’s efficiency, alongside the huge list of practical benefits, cloud comping will unlikely be superseded any time in the foreseeable future. In comparison to any other technology available, the potential of cloud computing is infinitely greater, meaning that until an even more impressive technology is developed, no technology will surpass it in data storage capabilities or efficiency.

        <p>
          Cyber security (also known as Cybersecurity) is the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks, which constitutes of a combination of facets, including physical, virtual, and philosophical technology. Also known as information technology security, Cyber security measures are designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originated from inside or outside of an organization. Cyber security focuses on defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks and data from malicious attacks. Although Cybersecurity professionals work hard to close security gaps, attackers are always looking for new ways to escape It’s notice, evade defence measures and exploit emerging weaknesses. The latest Cybersecurity threats are putting a new spin of known threats taking advantage of work from home environments remote access tools and new cloud services. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the threats cloud computing aims to control:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                •	Malware: The term malware refers to malicious software variants such as worms, viruses, trojans and spyware that provide unauthorized access or cause damage to a computer. Malware attacks are increasingly fileless and designed to get around familiar detection methods, such as antivirus tools, that scan for malicious attachments.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malware that locks down files, data or system and threatens to erase or destroy the data or make private or sensitive data to the public unless a ransom is paid to the cybercriminals. Who launched the attack. Recent ransomware attacks have targeted state and local governments which are easier to breach than organizations and under pressure to pay ransom in order to restore applications and web sites on which citizens rely.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Phishing/social engineering: Phishing is a form of social engineering that tricks users into providing their own PII or sensitive information such as credit card data or log in information. The FBI has noted about a surge in pandemic related phishing, tied to the growth of remote work.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Insider Threats: Current or former employees, business partners, contractors or anyone who has had access to systems or anyone who has had access to systems or networks in the past can be considered as insider threat if they abuse their access permissions. Insider threats can be invisible to traditional security like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, which focus on external threats.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Distributed denial of service(DDoS) attacks: A DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network from multiple coordinated systems. DDoS attacks overwhelm enterprise networks via the simple network management protocol (SNMP), used for modems, printers, switches, routers and servers
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Advance persistent Threats (APTs): In an APT, an intruder or group of intruders infiltrate a system and remain undetected for an extended period of time. The intruder leaves the networks and systems intact so that intruder can spy on business activity and steal sensitive data while avoiding the activation of defensive countermeasures. The recent Solar winds breach of United States government systems is an example of an APT.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Man-in-the-middle attacks: Man-in-the-middle is an eavesdropping attack where a cybercriminal intercepts and relays messages between two parties in order to steal data. For example, on an unsecure Wi-Fi network an attacker can intercept data being passed between guest’s device and network.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Trojans: A type of malware that is disguised as legitimate software. Cybercriminals trick users into uploading Trojans onto their computer where they can cause damage or collect data.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Spyware: A program that secretly records what a user does so that cybercriminals can use that information such as spyware could capture credit card details.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Botnets: Networks of malware infected computers which criminals use to perform tasks online without the user’s permission.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Businesses today are connected like never before. Our systems, users and data all live and operate in different environments. Perimeter based security is no longer adequate but implementing security controls within each environment creates complexity. The result in both cases is degraded protection for our most important assets. A zero-trust strategy assumes compromise and sets up controls to validate every user, device and connection into the business for authenticity and purpose.
          </p>


          <h6>What are the potential impacts of Cyber Security?</h6>
          <p>
            Cybersecurity is a growing concern for both individuals and businesses alike. Not only does it pose a physical threat to our personal privacy and security, but it also has a significant economic impact. According to National Institute of Standards and technology (NIST), cybersecurity costs United States economy more than $600 billion annually. In fact, in recent study by Ponemon Institute found that companies that are proactive in addressing cyber threats can experience a 36 percent increase in profits. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The following are the three ways it affects our society: 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                •	Cybersecurity affects our privacy in a significant way cybersecurity is all about protecting our information and privacy when hackers gain access to personal data, they can use it to steal identities, commit fraud or even spy on us. Cybersecurity can protect us from these types of attacks by ensuring that our data is secure and accessible only to those who should have access to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Cybersecurity affects our security in a significant way cybersecurity also protects our security if hackers can breach our security measures, they could gain access to our personal information as well as confidential company data by implementing strong cybersecurity measures, we can protect ourselves from these types of attacks and keep businesses safe from harm.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Cybersecurity affects our overall quality of life when we’re not able to access our email or online banking account, we feel inconvenienced and frustrated.

          <p>
            The impact of cyber security on society will continue to grow as the world becomes increasingly connected and reliant on technology. As such it is important for everyone including businesses, government agencies and individuals to take measures to protect themselves against online attacks. Cybersecurity is a big issue these days with so many people using the internet, business and governments are always looking for ways to keep their data safe, unfortunately this can also mean that we as citizens are at risk of our personal information being stolen or worse yet compromised as we all become more reliant on the internet it’s important to be proactive about cybersecurity and make sure that our online activities are protected.          
          </p>

          <h6>How might this affect us?</h6>
          <p>
            Cyber security is actually a vast field in IT sector which is unfortunately given the least importance. Everyday before leaving our homes we protect the property within by locking our doors, closing our windows or activating our security system we go to great lengths to ensure that our home have the necessary safeguards in place to thwart potential intruders and those who may try to steal it. When it comes to our confidential information however many of us use to fail to understand its importance that just like we lock our doors to protect our livelihood we hold dear, we must take decisive action to protect ourselves and our personal information from the burdensome ramifications of a cyberattack. Although many of us are aware of dangers that could result from sharing information with others, we use to often lack the knowledge that we need to protect ourselves and our families. This is where Cyber security steps in.          
          </p>
          <p>
            With ever growing information about personal information security from cyberattacks we are getting more aware of how to protect ourselves. Organizations and leader have started taking cyber security seriously and have started to develop new departments for cybersecurity. Those departments have the potential to employ more cyber security specialists who can understand weak points, learn from the past attacks and formulate strategies to deal with cyber-attacks. This means that more jobs become available every day, as Cybersecurity grows.          
          </p>
          <p>
            As the population continues to age and more people are living with disabilities, it is important that we take steps to protect them from identity theft and other cybercrimes. A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protection to defend against cybercrimes and needs different skill sets such as critical infrastructure security, network security, application security, cloud security, information security, end user education disaster recovery and business continuity planning, storage security and mobile security. The most urgent need at the moment is to make people aware of risks and educate them to come out of common rather dangerous cybersecurity myths such as cybercriminals are outsiders, risks are well known, attack vectors are contained and my industry is safe.

                •	Cost Reduction: Cloud computing works on the concept of pay per use, cloud computing helps in reducing the expenses of the company as resources are acquired only when they are needed, and payment is made as per usage. Cloud computing can cause a dramatic decrease in labour and maintenance costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                • Scalability: This is the key benefits of cloud computing as the client has flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources as per the requirements of the organization. Business need not worry about future demands as they can easily scale up the resources and acquire additional services anytime.                
              </p>
              <p>
                • Flexibility: Cloud computing provides a lot of flexibility. Customers and users are free to decide about the services which they want to use and pay also users have the option to switch from one cloud to another. Users can choose public, private or hybrid storage based on their security needs and other factors.                
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Almost Unlimited Storage: Users can store a lot more data on the cloud than their local physical storage devices. Moreover, companies can scale their storage capacity as per their requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                •	Disaster Recovery: A business using cloud computing need not prepare complex disaster recovery plans because the service provider takes care of such issues.

            Cloud computing is opposed by many, due to it’s supposed climate impact – even though it has been proven to be vastly more efficient than it’s rival technologies. Due to it’s efficiency, alongside the huge list of practical benefits, cloud comping will unlikely be superseded any time in the foreseeable future. In comparison to any other technology available, the potential of cloud computing is infinitely greater, meaning that until an even more impressive technology is developed, no technology will surpass it in data storage capabilities or efficiency.

          <div><h6>Block Chain and Crypto Currency; what is it?</h6></div>
        </div>
        
        <main>
          <p>
            Blockchain technology was first outlined in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two researchers who wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tempered with. But it was not until almost two decades later with the launch of bitcoin in January 2009 that blockchain has its first ever real-world application. The Bitcoin protocol is built on a blockchain. In a research paper introducing the digital currency. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakmoto referred to it as a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer to peer with no trusted third party.           
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are the key features of block chain and crypto currency:   
          </p>          
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  •	Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that it stores information. Blockchains store data in the blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	As new data comes in, it is entered onto a fresh block, once the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block which makes the data chained together in chronological order.                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Different types of information can be stored on blockchain, but the most common use so far had been a ledger for transections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control – rather all users collectively retain control.               
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin this means that transections are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.                
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
  
            <p>
              A digital asset blockchain cryptocurrency is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Unlike physical currencies, blockchain cryptocurrency works on digital channel and are often adhered to strong cryptography to secure financial transections that happen online. These cryptographs or encryption layers may also be used to control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets. Blockchain cryptocurrency can have several types. They are Bitcoins, Litecoin, Ripple, Blockchain, Ether etc. With the invent of blockchain currency it became possible to create something that is not possible to be duplicated and can be sent directly from one person to another. These transactions do not require a trusted third party, organization or computer sever in the middle that serves as the source of trust. The supply and value of the cryptocurrencies are controlled by the activities of their users and highly complex protocols which are built into governing codes. In particular the activities of miners – cryptocurrency users who anchor sophisticated computing functions to record transections and receive newly created cryptocurrency units and transection fee are sop critical to the stability and smooth functioning of cryptocurrencies.             
            </p>

            <p>
              The most striking difference between blockchain currency and physical currency is the fact that blockchain cryptocurrency uses a decentralized system of controlling transections as opposed to centralized digital currencies and central banking system. This decentralized feature is based on a distributed ledger technology which is typically a blockchain that serves as public financial transaction database.            
            </p>
  
  
            <h6>What are the potential impacts of Blockchain and Crypto currency?</h6>
            <p>
              Transparency seems to be the most important impact of blockchain cryptocurrencies. The transections have become more accurate and transparent. Among many other impacts the following are a few of them.            </p>
            <p>
              The following are the some ways it affects our society: 
            </p>
  
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  •	In banking it allows anyone to exchange money faster, efficient and more securely. Banks are already working on adopting blockchain technology to improve their transactions.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Blockchain has potential to address security concerns as it decentralizes all of the information and data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Use of advanced cryptography has made it resistant to unauthorized changes and hacks.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	With blockchain we can reduce bureaucracy and increase security, efficiency and transparency. Welfare and unemployment benefits could also be more easily verified and distributed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Votes could be counted and verified for legitimacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Blockchains can help ensure that money given for charity goes where we need it to go.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
  
  
            <p>
              The cryptographic attribute of blockchain presents a compelling reason for its use over other technologies but there are some potential pitfalls and unsolved conditions which may inhibit wide use of blockchain. Some of these concerns are as follows.            
            </p>

            <p>
              Some concerns about Block chain and Cryptocurrency include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  •	As with other record keeping systems once data is logged in one system transferring that data to a new system may be problematic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	As with adopting any new technology adopters must examine the business, legal and technical aspects of adopting blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	As with other forms of encryption the creation, storage and loss of private key creates problems that are unsolved.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Groups of users on the blockchain may combine computing resources and collude in mine block which is allowed and encouraged in some blockchain implementation. However, it does presents a situation where group of users may wield unintended influence over which transactions make into a block and the blocks that are posted.                
                </p>
                <p>
                  •	Another issue that affects blockchain also like other technologies is level of comfort and knowledge a user must have in order to properly and safely use it.                
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>


  
            <h6>How might this affect us?</h6>
            <p>
              Society today is filled with uncertainty and trust issues and their reasons are valid too. To be sure that we purchased coffee is really helping a coffee bean farmer in Ethiopia or that my date is actually who they say they are. We will need a system with strong security where records are stored, and facts are verified by many witnesses so that no one could cheat it. For most users the beauty of blockchain will remain will be in the unknown. Just as most of the people are unaware of how 4g technology works or how silicon is processed to produce central processing units, we continue to use our smartphones on a daily basis. Similarly, blockchain will be a perfect backstage to many changing technologies impacting everyone.            
            </p>
            <p>
              Agencies such as Securities and Exchange commission and the Commodities Future trading commission are issuing advisories to industry concerning blockchain technology. In some cases, these actions are to positively declare that the current legal framework governing other transactions also apply to transections on a blockchain.            
            </p>
            <p>
              General Service Administration and the Department of homeland security of US is examining blockchain as a way to achieve efficiencies in the current business of government. In these examinations the federal government is seeking ways to better manage the identities, assets, data and contracts.            
            </p>
            <p>
              The software that powers blockchain technology is open source and free that means developers can use program to build their decentralized applications on the blockchain(dapps). This is a great advantage to the business as they can build on a free existing code.            
            </p>
            <p>
              While the blockchain is still relatively new and many experiments will fail before they succeed the possibilities for innovation are endless. It will affect every sector such as retail, energy management, forecasting, consulting, real estate, insurance and much more. We as IT professionals should be well prepared ourselves for a future where distributed autonomous solutions will have a huge role in business and our personal lives.

            <p>
              An autonomous vehicle, also referred to as AV, is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by U.S. department of Transportation ranging from level 0 (fully manual) to level 5 (fully autonomous). In some ways the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is yet not finished, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.            
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology of automated vehicles comes in multiple levels:

                    •	Level 0 (No Driving Automation); - Most vehicles on the road today are level 0 manually controlled. The human provides the dynamic driving task although there maybe systems in place to help the driver. An example would be emergency braking system, since it technically doesn’t drive the vehicle. It does not qualify as automation.

                    •	Level 1 (Driver Assistance): - This is the lowest level of automation. The vehicle features a single automated system for driver assistance such as steering or acceleration (cruise control). Adoptive cruise control where the vehicle can be kept at a safe distance behind the nest car, qualifies as level 1 because the human driver monitors the other aspects of the driving such as steering and braking.

                </li>
                  <p>
                    • Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation): - This means advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS. The vehicle can control steering and accelerating/deaccelerating. Here the automation falls short of self-driving because the human sits in the driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. Tesla autopilot and Cadillac (General Motors) Super cruise control systems both qualify as level 2.

                  <p>
                    •	Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation): - The jump from level 2 to level 3 is substantial from a technological level but subtle if not negligible from a human perspective. Level 3 vehicles have environmental detection capabilities and can make informed decisions for themselves, such as accelerating past a slow-moving vehicle but the still require human override. The driver must remain alert and ready to control if the system is unable to execute the task.

                  <p>
                    •	Level 4 (High Driving Automation): -The key difference between Level 3 and Level 4 automation is that Level 4 vehicle can intervene if things go wrong or there is a system failure. In this sense these cars do not require human interaction in most circumstances. However, a human still has the option to manually override. Level 4 vehicles can operate in self driving mode but until legislation and infrastructure are in place, they can only do so within a limited area which is known as geofencing. Navya a French company is already building and selling level4 shuttles and cabs in US that run fully on electric power. Alphabet’s Waymo recently unveiled a level 4 self-driving taxi service in Arizona.

                  <p>
                    • Level 5 (Full Driving Automation): - Level 5 vehicles do not require human attention, the dynamic driving task is eliminated. Level 5 cars won’t have even steering wheel or accelerator and braking pedal. They will be free from geofencing, able to go anywhere and do anything that an human driver can do. Fully autonomous cars are undergoing testing in many pockets of the world, but none are yet available to general public.                  </p>

                A digital asset blockchain cryptocurrency is designed to work as a medium of exchange. Unlike physical currencies, blockchain cryptocurrency works on digital channel and are often adhered to strong cryptography to secure financial transections that happen online. These cryptographs or encryption layers may also be used to control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets. Blockchain cryptocurrency can have several types. They are Bitcoins, Litecoin, Ripple, Blockchain, Ether etc. With the invent of blockchain currency it became possible to create something that is not possible to be duplicated and can be sent directly from one person to another. These transactions do not require a trusted third party, organization or computer sever in the middle that serves as the source of trust. The supply and value of the cryptocurrencies are controlled by the activities of their users and highly complex protocols which are built into governing codes. In particular the activities of miners – cryptocurrency users who anchor sophisticated computing functions to record transections and receive newly created cryptocurrency units and transection fee are sop critical to the stability and smooth functioning of cryptocurrencies.

                Autonomous cars rely on presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lider is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road. Radars are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors and generate instructions to the car’s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration or dodge obstacles.

                Although AVs alone are unlikely to have significant direct impacts on energy consumption and GHG emission when AVs are effectively paired with other technologies and new transportation models, significant indirect and synergistic effects on economics, the environment and society are possible. One study found that when eco driving platooning, intersection connectivity and faster highway speeds are considered direct effects of connected and automated vehicles. Energy use and GHG emissions can be reduced by 9%.

                While the future of autonomous vehicles is promising and exiting mainstream production is still a few years away from anything higher than level 2 not because technological capabilities but because of security or the lack thereof. Earlier this year Ponemon Institute published a report titled “Securing the connected car: A study of Automotive Industry Cybersecurity Practices” the report found that connected vehicles like autonomous cars are rich in physical safety features such seatbelts, airbags, antilock brakes but not so rich in digital features. When it comes to what’s needed for safe operation in an online world connected cars are not yet ready for prime time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The report is based on a survey of 593 security practitioners, product development professionals and engineers. More than two thirds of respondents acknowledged that the need for better cybersecurity is urgent for obvious reasons. 62% said they think a malicious or proof of concept attack against automotive software/components is very likely in the next 12 months.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s fair to say that consumers will not accept autonomous cars unless they are confident that they will be at least as safe as they would be on a commercial jet, train or bus. The day is coming but automotive industry must get over a few speedbumps first.              
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car are very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes but if mass production is achieved their signals and frequency might interfere with each other.

                Many anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it’s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life and death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly transverses the road after steep turn.
