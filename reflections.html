          <p class="float-right center">We have evidence of our group communication over MS Teams and Trello, where we have consistently kept in touch while working on tasks. The Tools section of this document contains an invite link to our MS Teams Team, as well as our MS Teams meeting evidence. Further information can be found in the MS Teams Info PDF “Group2-MS.PDF” submitted along with this document.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">We also used Trello to break down the assignment into more manageable “cards”, which were then assigned to team members, where we could then provide updates on our progress, and move them to another “stack” once completed.
          To view all our Trello data please join our Trello Board at <a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/63b0a29a7d31fd04d45b041d/ATTI4b36907d71e02e8ed9b4d09d82719fa1CC0E3036/Intro%20to%20IT%20" target="_blank">https://trello.com/invite/b/63b0a29a7d31fd04d45b041d/<br>ATTI4b36907d71e02e8ed9b4d09d82719fa1CC0E3036/Intro%20to%20IT%20</a></p>
          <p class="float-right center">We have also used our Student Email (Outlook) and Collaborate Ultra (on Canvas) when corresponding with facilitators. The emails were relating to resolving an issue with an unresponsive team member, and the Collaborate Ultra sessions were in our weekly tutorial sessions where we discussed our progress and issues with Umera each week. All course facilitators were included on the emails, and the Collaborate Ultra sessions can be viewed via Canvas as evidence.</p>

          <h6 class="center">What went well?</h6>
          <p class="float-right center">Our team is made up of a good diversity of skills and aptitudes. When comparing our Myers-Briggs results from A1 it is apparent that there is also a range of personality types. This has worked in our favour to provide a good balance of different strengths and experience.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">Good communication and transparency with team members has also served us well. Each team member has been contributing and actioning tasks, while being accountable for their assigned work. Lachie’s leadership of our group has also helped – regularly being in touch, being approachable, and reliable.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">We feel that our group handled the issue of an unresponsive and non-contributing team member well. It was a difficult situation, but our team was cohesive and overcame it.</p>

          <h6 class="center">What could be improved?</h6>
          <p class="float-right center">Our team agrees that developing our technical skills would be beneficial. Being more structured at the beginning of the assignment while delegating tasks will also help. More structure would also help while keeping a task list up to date so it’s easier to see what is still outstanding.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">Our GitHub audit trail doesn’t reflect our group’s work very well, as team members have been learning how to use it over the course of this assignment. It would be good to have a heavier GitHub audit trail, and use Git in more advanced ways (e.g., multiple branches).</p>
          <p class="float-right center">Having set expectations of communication, regular contributions (i.e. Git Commits), and attendance of meetings – this would assist with identifying any potential repeat of our previous issue of an unresponsive team member.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">Over the course of this assignment, we have each reviewed other members’ work, and this hasn’t always been in a uniform way. We have now agreed as a group to using the Comments function when suggesting changes to Word documents.</p>

          <p class="float-right center">Ida - The functionality of the website has exceeded my expectations. We have all learnt more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout this assignment – which has resulted in an impressive website.</p>
          <p class="float-right center">Alex – The fact that the group has worked so well while spread across different timezones has surprised me. The team members have all been mindful of each other’s availability when scheduling meetings.</p>

          <p class="float-right center">Chris – The most surprising thing for me was that a group member would suddenly stop communicating with us, and not contribute. I had not even contemplated the possibility of that happening. Luckily, we were able to work through it as a team.</p>

We learned technical skills from other group members (e.g., GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and how to implement a team project in an IT environment. We learned how to work as a global team, communicating asynchronously and in regular meetings to keep on track. We’ve also learned how to make meaningful and frequent Git Commits to reflect what we’ve done in a more visible and trackable manner.</p>

          When the lecturers first indicated that we had to work in groups in assignments 2 and 3, to be honest I was quite worried about it. In my previous professional life, I have had major issues when trying to complete a project in the group, but this experience has been a great contrast. The communication and availability of all members has been paramount, the willingness to assist and explain tasks with transparency and ease has made the time much easier. I would like to highlight the cooperation and understanding of all team members to my situation being based 14 hours behind them and balancing a study-family life. Lachlan took on the role as leader with ownership and accountability, he ensured all members know their tasks and I never left a meeting not knowing what was expected of me. He handled the situation with Glenn and my brief absence with professionalism and calmness - essential traits in a leader. Chris’s efforts with the project have been vital, the late nights he spent fixing bugs and rewording documents made the project progress. Chris also took on the responsibility of conducting the interview that weighed heavily on the outcome of the assessment, asked compelling industry relevant questions, and additionally typed up the whole transcript - a monster effort. Ida took on the role with myself as web developer with ownership and accountability, with myself currently not being as skilled as her in coding, she took the time to even meet with me whilst accommodating my time zone to explain simple tasks and assist when needed. Ashwani also took on every role assigned to him with ownership and accountability, he got the “ball rolling” with his contributions to the group profile and took on extra tasks, and offered to help if I needed it, all whilst completing his own tasks. In conclusion this team has not just changed my outlook on group collaboration projects but in group collaboration in general.

          Working as a group is both advantageous, and difficult at the same time. While at first glance, it may seem that multiple people would always result in multiple times the productivity, this is not always the case. Throughout this task, every member of the group has added something valuable, while increasing the overall complexity of workflow. As the group leader, more members meant more hands for any given task. At the same time, there was a lot more organisational work to be done, than what would be required for a group of three members or less. I learned how critical it can be to track the tasks and progress of many group members, so that no single element of the task falls too far behind. I also learned how valuable it can be to work with a wide range of people, especially when you find all of their strengths and weaknesses, and plan accordingly. This group task has been a great learning experience.

          Our group was a well-balanced group with a wide variety of interests. This helped us to complete our assignment as we had a variety of knowledge and skills at our disposal. The main attribute that worked best for our group was our willingness to work hard to learn any skills that we did not already have and to contribute in any way that we could. Even working in different time zones worked out well. Alex was able to attend most of the We should, however, have focussed much earlier on the assignment document rather than the webpages. The most surprising thing about our project was how well it turned out. The webpages look amazing, and they work well too. The thing I learned about working in groups was that it is interesting to learn about the other team members and their lives, especially our overseas team member.

          Teamwork is not very new to me as I have worked in teams all my life, but there I worked mostly with my colleagues and known people. This was a surprise group and obviously surprised me as everyone was very new to each other. We came to start knowing each other very well so quickly. We were lucky to have such a diverse team as everyone is having different skill sets and different age groups. I have now got first-hand experience to work with a team where members were even in various parts of the world and from different time zones. This assignment has given us an opportunity to know each more and whenever I ran into some issues, my team members were there to help me in every possible way. We have done very well as a team and will be able to achieve more in the coming assignments. I should be thankful that I am part of such a great team who knows how to handle issues very well and include every member to contribute their best work to achieve team goals.

          To be honest, I was a bit apprehensive going into a group assignment, but I have ended up unexpectedly enjoying the process. Our group works quite well – the communication is good, and all (remaining) team members are engaged and want to do well. We are all willing to help each other which I feel helps the team be cohesive. I also like that every team member is genuinely friendly and approachable, without any arrogance or overconfidence. I have learnt a lot about how our group works well, and our individual strengths and weaknesses in an IT group environment. We handled the issue of having a team member become unresponsive quite well – it ended up only bringing us more together. I am looking forward to going into the next group assignment together and seeing how much more we grow together. I feel I am in a great team for my personality type – the team all make me feel comfortable to raise any concerns. I believe I will develop a lot of my skills during our time together as a group, e.g., technical skills, communication, and self-confidence in a team environment.
