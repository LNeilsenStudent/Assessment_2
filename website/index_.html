        <h3>Meet: Alex Milnes</h3>
        <main>My name is Alex, I am 30, I have relocated to Brasilia, Brazil, and I love it. I am a loving husband and Father of 
          twin boys with another set of twins on the way. I am Australian, born and raised in Sydney. I have studied after school; 
          my significant achievement is attaining the Diploma of Security and Risk Management, which created my interest in information 
          technology. I am a native English speaker and can speak Portuguese at an intermediate level; this has helped me professionally 
          and has created many opportunities. I am interested in physical activities and team sports. I like to read about politics 
          and economics, but I mostly enjoy sports, Cricket and Rugby being my favourites. The test results opened my eyes to my 
          attributes, and I was unaware of some traits the test claimed I had. I felt very accomplished with the result such as 
          “humanitarian”, “innovator”, and “caretaker”, which I believe are very authentic. However, I was also taken aback by 
          such claims of being “judging”; until now, I believed I did not display this trait. It would influence my behaviour positively 
          due to claims that I am a “humanitarian” and a “caretaker”. I am a team player and willing to perform any task assigned. I believe 
          I would excel at speaking and writing tasks due to having prior expierience with this before, where Git and GitHUb skills I found 
          difficulty with, but I am doing extra study to compensate.

        <h3>Meet: Christopher Box</h3>
        <main>My name is Christopher Box, I'm 42 years of age and live in Newcastle, NSW. I work at Telstra, in a team managing outages related 
          to landlines, and the customer faults affected by those outages. My hobbies include gaming, technology/gadgets, travel and astronomy/
          astrophotography. My interest in IT began at a young age, when I began gaming on a computer at Dad's work. This developed over the 
          years into also building PCs, networks, and troubleshooting technical issues for friends and family. My Myers-Briggs Test outcome 
          'ISTJ-T Logistician', which means practical, fact-minded and reliable. I work best with some structure and leadership, and am reliable 
          in a role that requires me to complete defined tasks to a clear schedule. My learning Style Test outcome 'Visual Learner', which means 
          that I remember what I see over what I hear and that I prefer to read/write rather than listen to information. In my group I would 
          learn best using visuals such as a shared whiteboard - Trello in our case. Team Roles Test outcome 'Completer, Team Player, Expert', 
          which means the top 3 roles in a group that suit me best are: at the end of a task, to polish and scrutinise the work for errors; 
          diplomacy, team cohesion and helping others; being trusted to complete specific tasks working alone. My student number is: </main>

        <h3>Meet: Ashwani Choudhry</h3>
        <h2></h2>
        <main>Ashwani was born in India, migrated to Australia six years ago and is Australian citizen now. Had a degree in Mechanical
           engineering but could not carry over due to surname issues. Having a lot of experience in using software's related to mechanical 
           engineering such as CAD, CAM, Solidworks and has worked CRMs like salesforce and SAP. My hobbies are Playing cricket, basketball, 
           golf, enjoy long walks and some gardening.
           My classification in the Myers-Briggs test is 'Assertive Consul'(ESFJ-A) which means that I am thought to be down to earth with 
           a strong focus on what's happening or likely to happen. I will bring a high-level of organizion but also an even temper and 
           a resistant to stress. My Learning styles test shows that I learn best through hands-on experience and that I get a lot of satisfaction 
           building things. My big-5 test shows that I bring concientiousness to my team and that I strive for high achievement.

        <h3>Meet: Lachlan Neilsen - Team Leader</h3>
          <main>My name is Lachlan Neilsen, I am a High Voltage Tester, and I have recently commenced Bachelor of IT with RMIT. 
            I am a slightly introverted, open-minded worker with a primarily hands-on learning style. My greatest strength 
            (as highlighted by Myer-Briggs) is my persistent need for clear, decisive answers. As an INTJ-A personality type, 
            I pay great attention to detail, and as a result I usually complete tasks at a very high standard. My Greatest 
            weakness (as highlighted by Big 5 results) is a relatively low extraversion, coupled with 69% neuroticism. If care 
            is not taken this could lead to insular work patterns, and disproportionate doubt in my work.

        <h3>Meet: Glenn Norris</h3>
        <main>IT for me started at a very young age as I was brought up with it all around me because my father was deep in the 
          electronic field, so naturally I followed suit and it all I have really ever know is IT and Electronics. As soon as I 
          was out of year 10 I fell into a position where was running a Service dept for a local company fixing everything from 
          PC's to Printers and photocopies all the way up to enterprise level server hardware for a contract the business held.
          The results of my Myer-Briggs test classed me as an adventurer and it will help me bring some extraversion to the team 
          and a high level of assertiveness. The big-5 test shows that I am inclined to be concientious and my primary learning 
          style is practical.

        <h3>Meet: Sjoukje Ida Gange</h3>
        <main>My name is Sjoukje Ida Gange usually called Ida. I worked for many years in Information Management, however my work 
          was becoming more technology oriented. Since I very much enjoyed this aspect of my work and wanted to learn more, I enrolled
           in the Bachelor of Information Technology with OUA/RMIT. According to 16 personalities I am an Advocate and a good diplomat. 
           However, being inclined to perfectionism, I need to be careful not to impose my expectations on my team members. According 
           to the VARK test I am mostly a visual learner although I also score highly with read/write skills and on the Big 5, I score 
           very low on Extraversion and other qualities related to social skills which means that I need to work hard to develop 
           relationships with other team members.
