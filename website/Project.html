            The Quick Quotes Calculator (QQC) is a mobile app which aims to streamline the process of quoting jobs. The QQC will primarily be targeted towards tradespeople and sole traders who regularly need to quote complex jobs. The app would allow the user to quickly tally up the quantity and cost price for each line item of any given task, with users being able to customize job names and types, making it a more streamlined and accurate process. This information is used to instantly generate an itemized quote that is individualized and can be exported to other apps such as email for streamlined customer communication.

                According to Hipages, 2023, “trade workers spend an average of seven hours a week preparing quotes”. This equates to nearly 20% of the entire working week. Much of this time is spent summing up quantities, and total values for each job item. If the tradesperson were to make any errors in calculations, many hours may be spent trying to find the mistake. This figure will likely grow as jobs get more complex, and Australia’s math skills decline <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/03/australian-students-maths-performance-falls-to-oecd-average-in-worst-result-since-2000">(Karp, 2019)</a> . By instantly generating quotes, QQC mitigates any risk of miscalculation, saving time and money for the business.

            The app itself provides a database of all previous quotes generated by the user. From this UI, the user can easily view a list of the quote history, complete with a basic summary of the job name, number of items on the quote, and the total quote price. This basic information about each quote helps the user easily find previous jobs, and quickly view the total quote value. This is useful for quickly finding and comparing previously entered quotes. The user may also wish to export a quote to a PDF, for seamless generation of customer quotes and receipts. This feature will likely be the primary source of monetisation within the app, as it is not required for the app to work but may be highly desirable for some businesses who wish to further streamline their workflow. From here the user may choose to view an existing quote by selecting the quote they want to view or generate a new quote by selecting the New Quote option – both routes will navigate the user to the Quote View window. In Quote View, the User Interface (UI) displays a list of job items, which each include an Item name, price per unit, and total price. At the top of the UI, the job/quote name is displayed, along with a Total quote value dollar figure which is updated every time any changes are made within the quote. For a new quote, these fields are filled with default values, and only one line item is added to the list. The default values act to give the user some pointers on where their desired job information should go (i.e. the default value for the overall job title would be “Job Title”). If the user has navigated here by selecting a previous quote, an appropriate number of line items are automatically added to the list, and all fields are populated as per the selected quote.

            The key to this app’s power is the front-end component of this window. All line items are stored in a scrollable list, for easy viewing of limitless line items. Each line item has editable fields, and also includes arrows to the left and right of the quantity counter. This means that the user may simply press a button to add or subtract from the quantity of a line item, rather than having to select and edit the text inside the quantity field. The difference between a button interface and text input field seems trivial at first glance, but dramatically streamlines workflow, and is one of the key features of our app. Toward the bottom of this window will be options to delete the quote from the database, discard any changes, or save as a new quote. All of these features would be presented in a clean, easy-to-read format, with high contrast elements. This ensures maximum user accessibility and readability, making it and easy tool for anyone to use.            <br>
