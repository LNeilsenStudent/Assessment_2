          <p>To gain an insight into the practical experience of working as an IT professional, we interviewed Nathan Stewart.
            Nathan has had an extensive career in IT, working across many different areas within the IT sector - and is currently
            a manager within Cyber Security.</p>
          <p>We asked Nathan a variety of questions concerning his job and the tasks and interactions involved; career and education;
            and the IT sector. Throughout the interview, one main theme was clear: if one wishes to succeed in IT, it is critical
            that they have a strong purpose which aligns with the key elements of the IT industry: to enhance, advance, simplify and
            innovate solutions.</p>
          <p>It was also apparent that the human aspect of IT was just as (if not more) important than the technical aspect. Communicating
            with others is key, to ensure that the right technology is implemented correctly for a specific client. There's not much
            point in delivering an IT project which does not suitably meet that clients' needs.</p>
          <p>One other important learning from this interview was how, as Nathan's career progressed, the knowledge from his previous roles
            fed forward into how he could perform optimally in the next. Both the technical, and non-technical skills were used repeatedly,
            and improved upon, throughout his career.  This has culminated to result in a role where
            he has found his ideal balance of skills, where Nathan can thrive while also satiating his hunger for IT.</p>
          <p>Speaking with Nathan was informative and delivered an interesting insight into the everyday experience of working as an IT
            professional. We learned about the positive and negative aspects of working as an IT professional, and just how broad the
            definition of IT is. Nathan provided some fantastic advice that anyone considering a career in IT should keep in mind, and
            explained why it is a great time to be entering the IT sector. We really appreciate Nathan's time sharing
            his excitement and passion for IT, and look forward to seeing how his career continues to develop in the ever-changing
            world of IT.</p>
